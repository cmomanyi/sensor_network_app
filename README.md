# sensor_network
This applications does a simulation of different sensor networks, Soil sensor network, Atmospheric sensor network, Plant health sensors and Threat detection sensors.
1. Soil Sensor Network
- Monitor soil parameters such as moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient levels.
- Detect changes that could affect plant growth or signal anomalies.

2. Atmospheric Condition Sensors
- Measure air temperature, humidity, CO₂ concentration, wind speed, and rainfall.
- Help in predicting environmental impact on crops.

3. Plant Health Sensors
- Monitor plant health indicators such as leaf moisture, chlorophyll level, and disease detection.
- Detect early signs of disease, stress, or nutrient deficiency.

4. Threat Detection Sensors
- Detect cyber-physical threats like unauthorized access, jamming, tampering, or anomalous behavior.
- Protect the system from attacks targeting IoT infrastructure.
