# soilsemsornetwork
Simulate a 24-hour soil sensor network.  Sensors wake every 15 minutes, sense (soil temp, moisture, pH), transmit, sleep.  Simulate battery drain and sensor compromise if the battery gets too low.  Plot graphs at the end showing:  Battery levels over time  Temperature, moisture, and pH readings over time
